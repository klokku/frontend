# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json for dependency installation
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies (npm ci ensures a clean install)
RUN npm ci

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the project files into the container

LABEL authors="jozala"

# Step 8: Copy the built files from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Copy a custom Nginx configuration file if needed
COPY docker/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Step 10: Expose port 80 to serve the app
